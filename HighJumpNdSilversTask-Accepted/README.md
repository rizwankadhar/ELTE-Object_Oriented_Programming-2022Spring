The results of the participants of a high school sports championship were recorded in a text file. One line of the file contains the name of the participant (a single word without spaces), the identifier of the school (a single word without spaces, starts with the zip code), then the places earned by the participant in the form of sport, place (a single word without space, natural number) pairs. The data in a line are separated by spaces. The file is sorted by the identifier of the school. You can assume that the file is correct. An example line of the file:
Peter 1063Szinyei run100 3 swimming500 1 highjump 1

Task: Find a contestant who participated in high jump, and whose best place is a silver medal. Also print the school the contestant is from, and the number of silver medals they've earned.
